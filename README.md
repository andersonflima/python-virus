# Python self-replicate virus

This code will clone itself and insert it into other py/pyw scripts that are in the same directory

The functionality of the other scripts will be the same, but with an addition of the virus that repeats the same action of cloning in other scripts

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
python  ^3.8
```

### Installing

This code just need python to run.

## Run

```
python main.py
```

To see the effectiveness of this command I added 2 (two) files file_1.py and file_2.pyw which are empty, if you want you can add some code inside them, so that you can see what the main code really does
